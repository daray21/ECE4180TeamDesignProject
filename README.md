### ECE 4180 Team Design Project 

Developed and maintained by

### Project Overview
The idea behind this project is to create a Simon Says type of game using inputs from the IMU, or Inertial Measurement Unit. This game can take up to four inputs, up, down, left, right, and the goal of the game is to memorize the sequence of directional inputs the game will display using the external LEDs. The game will initially start with one direction in the sequence, and as more correct sequences are inputted, more directional inputs are added to the sequence, up to a maximum of 10 inputs, by which the game ends and the player wins. The user will have the option to choose between four different levels, all with different random sequences, before the game starts.
